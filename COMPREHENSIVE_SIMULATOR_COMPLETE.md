## üßÆ THE MATH REVEALED

### Example Calculation:

**Property:**
- 2,500 sqft in Tampa (Hillsborough)
- Built 1985 (40 years old)
- 12-year roof
- Frame construction

**Systems:**
- Modern breaker panel ‚úÖ
- Copper plumbing ‚úÖ

**Location:**
- 8 miles from coast (Zone 3)
- 600 ft to hydrant ‚úÖ

**Features:**
- No wind mitigation
- No pool, no dogs

**Personal:**
- Credit: Fair (640-699)
- No claims

**Calculation:**
```
Replacement Cost: 2,500 √ó $150 = $375,000

Base Premium: $375,000 √ó 0.8% = $3,000

Tampa County (√ó1.2): $3,000 √ó 1.2 = $3,600
Frame Construction (+15%): $3,600 √ó 1.15 = $4,140
12-Year Roof (+25%): $4,140 √ó 1.25 = $5,175
40-Year Building (+30%): $5,175 √ó 1.30 = $6,728
Wind Zone 3 (+10%): $6,728 √ó 1.10 = $7,401
Credit Fair (√ó1.0): $7,401 √ó 1.0 = $7,401
Claims-Free (-5%): $7,401 √ó 0.95 = $7,031

Fees (+$85): $7,031 + $85 = $7,116

4-Point Inspection: +$150

FINAL: $7,266/year ($606/month)
```

**This is REALISTIC for that risk profile!**
