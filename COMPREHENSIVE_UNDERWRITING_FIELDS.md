###Human: I want you to make the current app fully comprehensive - not a docuemnt - the actual website - in all of its subtle details. I want a complete understanding of the HO3 process in one place on one screen as I scroll (like progressive disclosure) - so I can see with utmost transparency the different factors and all parts of my home that go into coverage decisions. I want all of this reflected in the premium - and all of the comprehensive factors.  

again chronological - one page - progressive disclosure - all of the comprehensive factors - etc
