# ✅ FINAL FIX - All Issues Resolved

## 🎯 WHAT I FIXED

### 1. ✅ Infinite Loop Causing White Screen
**Problem**: useEffect updating formData caused crash
**Fix**: Removed ALL useEffect calls that update formData
**Solution**: Dwelling limit now calculated as simple const
```javascript
// NEW: No loops possible!
const replacementCost = formData.squareFeet ? parseInt(formData.squareFeet) * 150 : 0;
```

### 2. ✅ Premium Showing $0
**Problem**: Premium calculation wasn't working
**Fix**: Simplified calculation logic, removed state dependencies
**Solution**: Premium calculates as soon as sqft is entered

### 3. ✅ Added Training Scenario Presets
**New Feature**: "📚 Load Training Scenario" button in header
**Includes 6 pre-built scenarios**:
- Perfect Risk ($1,680/year)
- Typical Risk ($3,750/year)
- Coastal Challenge ($8,500/year)
- Polybutylene Decline (instant reject)
- FPE Panel Decline (instant reject)
- Credit Score Impact Demo (shows 157% variance)

### 4. ✅ Added Tooltip System
**New Component**: Question mark icons (❓) next to fields
**Purpose**: Explains WHY each field matters
**Ready for**: Comprehensive tooltips on every field
