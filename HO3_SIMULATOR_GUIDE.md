# HO3 Single-Page Training Simulator - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Built

A **focused, single-page training simulator exclusively for HO3 (Standard Homeowners Insurance)** - the most common policy type covering owner-occupied homes.

---

## 🎯 What is HO3?

**HO3 = Standard Homeowners Insurance Policy**

### Key Facts:
- **For**: Owner-occupied primary residences ONLY
- **Coverage**: House structure + Personal belongings + Liability + Living expenses
- **Market Share**: 95% of homeowners have HO3 policies
- **Requirements**: 
  - Owner must live in the home
  - Property must be well-maintained
  - Stricter underwriting than rental policies

### Not HO3:
- **DP3**: Rental/investment properties (landlord policy)
- **HO6**: Condo unit owners (walls-in coverage)
- **HO4**: Renters insurance (no building coverage)

---

## 🚀 Major Changes from 8-Step Wizard

### Before (Old Design):
- ❌ 8 separate steps with navigation
- ❌ See results only at the end
- ❌ No real-time feedback
- ❌ Generic "property insurance"
- ❌ Limited educational content

### After (New Single-Page Design):
- ✅ One continuous page
- ✅ **Real-time risk meter** updates as you type
- ✅ **Live carrier eligibility** shows who will/won't write
- ✅ **Instant premium calculation** updates with each field
- ✅ **HO3-specific** education throughout
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure** - sections appear when ready
- ✅ **Educational sidebar** explains every decision

## 📊 New Components

### 1. Risk Meter (Top Header)
**What it shows**: Visual gauge from 0-100
- **0-30** (Green): PREFERRED - Best rates, all carriers
- **31-50** (Yellow): STANDARD - Normal rates
- **51-70** (Orange): SUBSTANDARD - Limited carriers
- **71-100** (Red): DECLINE/E&S - Very limited options

**Updates in real-time based on**:
- Roof age (biggest factor)
- Wind zone exposure
- Claims history
- Building age
- Wind mitigation features

### 2. Live Carrier Matrix (Right Sidebar)
Shows 5 major Florida carriers:
- Progressive
- Universal Property
- Tower Hill
- FedNat
- Citizens (always available)

**Real-time status**:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Eligible (shows estimated premium)
- ❌ Red X = Declined (shows why)
- 🔄 Gray = Pending (waiting for more info)

**Educational Value**: 
Teaches trainees which carriers write what risks and WHY they decline.

### 3. Educational Sidebar (Right)
**Context-sensitive help** that changes based on current field:

- Focuses on **roofAge**? Shows roof age matrix
- Focuses on **windZone**? Explains hurricane deductibles
- Focuses on **coverage**? Shows HO3 coverage structure
- Default view? Explains what HO3 is

**Shows current risk factors** at bottom:
- Roof age
- Wind zone
- Claims count

### 4. Running Premium Display (Top Header)
- **Annual premium**: Updates as fields change
- **Monthly payment**: Annual ÷ 12
- Shows "---" until enough info to calculate

---

## 📋 Six Interactive Sections

### Section 1: HO3 Eligibility Quick Check
**Purpose**: Immediately identify if property qualifies for HO3

**Fields**:
1. **Do you live in this home?**
   - Owner-occupied ✅ → Continue to HO3
   - Rental ❌ → "Need DP3 instead" (teaches difference)
   - Seasonal ⚠️ → "May need endorsement"

2. **Roof Age** ← **MOST IMPORTANT FIELD**
   - 0-10 years: ✅ "All HO3 carriers available"
   - 11-15 years: ⚠️ "Limited carriers"
   - 16-20 years: ⚠️ "Very limited"
   - 20+ years: ❌ "Citizens or replacement needed"

**Why this section matters**:
- These two questions eliminate 80% of unsuitable risks
- Saves time by stopping early if not HO3-eligible
- Teaches difference between HO3, DP3, HO6

### Section 2: Property Details
**Reveals after**: Occupancy = owner + Roof age entered

**Fields**:
- Property Address
- Year Built (triggers inspection requirements)
- Square Footage (calculates replacement cost)
- Exterior Walls (CBS = best, Frame = higher rate)
- Roof Shape (Hip = 12% discount!)

**Auto-calculations**:
- Building age → 4-point inspection if 40+ years
- Roof shape = Hip → Shows wind mitigation discount
- Square footage + County → Calculates dwelling limit

### Section 3: Florida Location & Risk
**Reveals after**: Square footage + County entered

**Fields**:
- County (all 67 Florida counties)
- Distance to Coast → **Auto-calculates Wind Zone**
- Flood Zone (VE/AE/X)

**Wind Zone Logic**:
- 0-1 mile = Zone 1 (🔴 Red alert, very limited)
- 1-2.5 miles = Zone 2 (🟠 Orange, limited)
- 2.5-5 miles = Zone 3 (🟡 Yellow, moderate)
- 5+ miles = Zone X (🟢 Green, all carriers)

**Educational Moment**:
Shows exact hurricane deductible amount:
"$400,000 home × 5% = **$20,000 out of pocket**"

### Section 4: Wind Mitigation Features
**Reveals after**: Location completed

**Fields**:
- Opening Protection (None → Impact glass = 20% discount)
- Roof to Wall Connection (Toe nails → Double wraps = 15%)

**Live Savings Calculator**:
Shows running total of discounts:
- Hip roof: 12%
- Impact glass: 20%
- Roof straps: 15%
- **Total: Up to 45% savings!**

**Educational Value**:
"These features can save $500-1,500/year on HO3 premiums!"

### Section 5: Claims History
**Reveals after**: Location completed

**Two buttons**:
- ✅ No Claims → "Claims-free discount!"
- ⚠️ Has Claims → (would show claim entry form)

**Impact on Risk Meter**:
- 0 claims: Score -5 (better)
- 1 claim: Score +15
- 2 claims: Score +30
- 3+ claims: Score +50 (likely decline)

### Section 6: HO3 Coverage Structure
**Reveals after**: All previous sections + Dwelling calculated

**Shows HO3 Coverage Formula**:
```
Coverage A (Dwelling): $400,000 (calculated from sq ft)
Coverage B (Other Structures): $40,000 (10% of A)
Coverage C (Personal Property): $200,000 (50% of A)
Coverage D (Loss of Use): $80,000 (20% of A)
```

**User Selects**:
- Liability Limit: $100k, $300k, $500k, $1M
- All Other Perils Deductible: $1k, $2.5k, $5k, $10k
- Hurricane Deductible: 2%, 5%, 10% (shows dollar amount!)

**Educational Moment**:
"In HO3, Coverage A drives everything else. This is different from DP3."

## 🎓 HO3-Specific Educational Content

Throughout the app, content emphasizes **why HO3 is unique**:

### Key Teaching Points:

1. **HO3 vs Other Policies**
   - HO3 = Owner lives there
   - DP3 = Landlord owns, tenant lives there
   - HO6 = Condo owner (master policy covers building)

2. **Roof Age is King in HO3**
   - Owners expected to maintain roofs
   - HO3 carriers stricter than DP3
   - After 15 years, options drop dramatically

3. **Owner-Occupied = Better Rates**
   - HO3 gets 15% discount vs DP3
   - Because owners maintain better than tenants
   - Lower claims frequency

4. **HO3 Coverage Structure**
   - Coverage A is foundation
   - B, C, D are percentages of A
   - This is standard for HO3, varies in other policies

5. **Florida-Specific HO3 Rules**
   - Hurricane deductibles are percentages
   - Wind mitigation discounts are mandatory
   - Flood insurance is ALWAYS separate
   - Roof age matters more in FL than anywhere
