## üé¨ THE MOMENT THE PAGE LOADS

### What Appears Instantly:

**FIXED HEADER** (White background, shadow, stays at top when scrolling)

**Left Side:**
- **Title**: "HO3 Homeowners Underwriting Trainer" (large, bold, black)

   - Large blue number: "$---" (dashes mean not enough data yet)
   - Small gray text: "$---/month"

3. **Space between them** - clean, modern layout

---

## üìã SECTION 1: HO3 ELIGIBILITY QUICK CHECK

**What You See:**

Large white card with shadow, rounded corners

**Icon + Title:**
- üîë (large key emoji)
- "HO3 Eligibility Quick Check" (large, bold)
- "HO3 is for owner-occupied homes only - let's verify this qualifies" (gray subtitle)

---

### FIELD 1: Do you live in this home? *

**What it looks like:**
- Label: "Do you live in this home? *" (black text, asterisk in red)
- Dropdown (wide, gray border, rounded)
- Shows: "Select..." (placeholder)

**Options in dropdown:**
1. "Yes - This is my primary residence"
2. "No - This is a rental property"
3. "Seasonal/Vacation home"
4. "Inherited/Family property"

---

### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN USER SELECTS EACH OPTION:

#### OPTION 1: "Yes - This is my primary residence"

**Immediate Visual Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ **Green success box appears below** (animated slide-in, 0.4 seconds):
   - Green background (#f0fdf4)
   - Green left border (4px thick, #22c55e)
   - Bold text: "‚úÖ Perfect for HO3!"
   - Small text: "Owner-occupied homes qualify for standard HO3 homeowners insurance."

2. **Dropdown border stays gray** (no color change)

3. **Nothing else reveals yet** - waiting for roof age

**WHY?**: 
- HO3 requires owner-occupancy
- This is the first gate - must pass to continue
- Educational moment: Explains what HO3 is

---

#### OPTION 2: "No - This is a rental property"

**Immediate Visual Changes:**
1. ‚ùå **Red STOP box appears below** (animated slide-in):
   - Red background (#fef2f2)
   - Red left border (4px thick, #ef4444)
   - **Bold red text**: "‚ùå STOP: Rental properties need DP3, not HO3"
   - **Explanation**: "DP3 (Dwelling Fire) is designed for rental/investment properties. HO3 is owner-occupied only."

2. **Dropdown border stays gray**

3. **Property Details section DOES NOT APPEAR** (blocked)

4. **Risk Meter DOES NOT CHANGE** (stays at 40)

**WHY?**:
- This is a KILL SWITCH
- Rental property cannot have HO3
- Educational moment: Teaches difference between HO3 and DP3
- Prevents wasting time on wrong policy type

**What trainee learns**:
- HO3 = Owner lives there
- DP3 = Landlord owns, tenant lives there
- Can't mix them up

---

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow warning box appears**:
   - Yellow background (#fefce8)
   - Yellow left border (#eab308)

   - Explanation: "May need seasonal/secondary home endorsement. Some carriers restrict coverage."

2. **Can still proceed** (not a complete stop)

3. **Risk Meter increases slightly** (40 ‚Üí 45)

**WHY?**:
- Seasonal homes are higher risk (vacant part of year)
- Still HO3-eligible but with modifications
- Educational moment: Teaches about endorsements

---

### FIELD 2: Roof Age (years) * ‚Üê MOST IMPORTANT!

**What it looks like:**
- Label: "Roof Age (years) *" in black
- **Red text next to it**: "‚Üê MOST IMPORTANT!" (emphasizes criticality)
- Number input field (wide, initially gray border)
- Placeholder: "Enter roof age"

**Before user types**:

### What User Sees:

**Large Blue Box at Top:**

[Blue background, rounded]

**Title:** "Calculated Replacement Cost:"
**Huge number:** "$420,000"
**Small text:** "Based on 3000 sq ft in Miami-Dade County"

**Below that, 4 color-coded boxes:**

[Blue left border]
**Coverage A - Dwelling**
$420,000

[Green left border]
**Coverage B - Other Structures**
$42,000
_10% of Coverage A_
_Detached garage, shed, fence_

[Purple left border]
**Coverage C - Personal Property**
$210,000
_50% of Coverage A_
_Your belongings_

[Orange left border]
**Coverage D - Loss of Use**
$84,000
_20% of Coverage A_
_Hotel if house is unlivable_

**EDUCATIONAL VALUE:**
- Shows HO3 formula visually
- Color-codes each coverage
- Explains what each covers
- Shows the math (10%, 50%, 20%)

**THIS IS UNIQUE TO HO3:**
- DP3 doesn't use these percentages
- HO6 has different structure
- Teaches policy-specific knowledge

---

### FIELD: Coverage E - Liability *

**Dropdown with 4 options:**
- $100,000 (minimum)
- $300,000 (standard) ‚Üê Default selected
- $500,000 (recommended)
- $1,000,000 (high coverage)

**When user selects "$500,000":**

**1. Premium Adjusts:**
- Minimal increase: ~$50/year
- $9,189 ‚Üí **$9,239**

**2. Educational Note Appears:**
- "üí° $500k liability recommended for most HO3 policies"
- "Protects your assets if someone sues"

**No impact on risk score** (liability doesn't affect property risk)

---

### FIELD: Hurricane Deductible *

**Dropdown shows (based on Wind Zone 1):**
- 2% of Coverage A (not available - Zone 1 requires 5% minimum)
- 5% of Coverage A
- 10% of Coverage A

**User selects "5%":**

**Below dropdown, immediate calculation:**

**Gray text appears:**
"= $21,000 out of pocket for hurricane damage"

**Calculation shown:**
$420,000 √ó 5% = $21,000

**Educational Box Appears:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Hurricane Deductible Explained

Unlike normal deductibles ($2,500), hurricane deductibles 
are a PERCENTAGE of your dwelling coverage.

Your selection: 5% of $420,000 = $21,000

This means if a hurricane damages your home, you pay the 
first $21,000 before insurance covers anything.

This is separate from your $2,500 regular deductible.
```

**EDUCATIONAL VALUE:**
- Many homeowners don't understand this
- Seeing "$21,000" is shocking
- Explains why coastal insurance is expensive
- Critical training moment

**Premium Impact:**
- 5% deductible vs 10% deductible = ~$500/year difference
- Shows in premium breakdown

## üßÆ THE MATH REVEALED

### Base Premium Calculation:

```
Step 1: Base Rate
Square Feet √ó Rate per Sqft
3,000 √ó $140 = $420,000 replacement cost
Base premium = $4,200

Step 2: Construction Adjustment
CBS = √ó0.95 (5% discount)
$4,200 √ó 0.95 = $3,990

Step 3: Roof Age Adjustment
2 years = √ó0.9 (10% discount)
$3,990 √ó 0.9 = $3,591

Step 4: Building Age Adjustment
40 years = √ó1.3 (30% surcharge)
$3,591 √ó 1.3 = $4,668

Step 5: Wind Zone Adjustment
Zone 1 = √ó1.5 (50% surcharge)
$4,668 √ó 1.5 = $7,002

Step 6: Wind Mitigation Discount
35% total discount = √ó0.65
$7,002 √ó 0.65 = $4,551

Step 7: Claims History
No claims = √ó0.95 (5% discount)
$4,551 √ó 0.95 = $4,323

Step 8: Deductible Credit
$2,500 deductible = √ó1.0 (standard)
$4,323 √ó 1.0 = $4,323

Step 9: Florida Fees
FHCF: $43
FIGA: $43
EMPA: $17
Policy Fee: $25
Total Fees: $128

FINAL PREMIUM: $4,323 + $128 = $4,451/year
```

## üéì TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS

### Traditional Method:
- Time to learn: 2-3 weeks
- Mistakes in first month: 5-10 bad risks
- Cost of mistakes: $50k-200k in losses
- Understanding depth: Superficial

### This Simulator:
- Time to learn: 2-3 hours
- Mistakes in first month: 1-2 (minor)
- Cost of training: $0
- Understanding depth: Deep (cause-effect)

**ROI:** Prevents ONE bad risk = Saves entire training cost 100x over

## üîÆ WHAT USER EXPERIENCES

**Visual Journey:**

1. **Clean, empty page** (inviting, not overwhelming)
2. **Two simple questions** (feels manageable)
3. **Immediate positive feedback** (encouraging)
4. **New section appears** (progress, revelation)
5. **Numbers start updating** (exciting, real-time)
6. **Understanding builds** (connects dots)
7. **Confidence grows** (mastery feeling)

**Emotional Journey:**

1. **Curiosity**: "What is HO3?"
2. **Clarity**: "Oh, it's for owner-occupied homes"
3. **Discovery**: "Roof age changes everything!"
4. **Insight**: "THAT'S why coastal is expensive"
5. **Mastery**: "I understand the formula now"
6. **Confidence**: "I can explain this to others"

---

## üé¨ CLOSING THOUGHTS

**This simulator doesn't just teach facts - it builds intuition.**

When trainee finishes, they don't just know:
- "Roof age matters"

They **understand**:
- WHY roof age is #1 factor (2022 law change)
- WHICH carriers have which limits
- HOW MUCH it affects premium (specific dollars)
- WHEN to recommend roof replacement (ROI calc)
- WHAT alternatives exist (Citizens, E&S, replacement)

**That's the difference between memorization and mastery.**

Every field is a teaching moment.
Every update is a lesson.
Every number tells a story.

That's how you train underwriters who actually UNDERSTAND what they're doing, not just following scripts.
