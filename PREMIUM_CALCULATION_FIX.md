# CRITICAL FIX: Premium Calculation Corrected

## üö® What Was Wrong

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// Was using dwelling value AS the premium
const baseRate = sqft * (sqftRate * 100);  // This was $420,000 for 3000 sqft
let premium = baseRate;  // Premium = $420,000/year ‚ùå WRONG!

Result: $243,190/year ($20,266/month) - Impossible!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
// Calculate replacement cost first
const replacementCost = sqft * 150;  // $450,000 for 3000 sqft

// Then calculate premium as PERCENTAGE of replacement cost
const baseRatePercent = 0.008;  // 0.8% is typical Florida
let premium = replacementCost * baseRatePercent;  // $3,600/year ‚úÖ CORRECT!

Result: $3,600/year ($300/month) - Realistic!
```

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECTED PREMIUM FORMULA

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

```javascript
// EXAMPLE: 2,500 sqft home in Orlando, 12-year roof, CBS construction

// STEP 1: Calculate Replacement Cost
replacementCost = 2,500 sqft √ó $150/sqft = $375,000

// STEP 2: Apply Base Rate
baseRate = 0.008 (0.8% of dwelling value)
basePremium = $375,000 √ó 0.008 = $3,000

// STEP 3: County Multiplier
Orlando = 1.0x (baseline)
Miami-Dade = 1.5x (50% higher)
Jacksonville = 0.85x (15% lower)

For Orlando: $3,000 √ó 1.0 = $3,000

// STEP 4: Construction Adjustment
CBS = 0.90x (10% discount)
$3,000 √ó 0.90 = $2,700

// STEP 5: Roof Age Multiplier (BIGGEST IMPACT)
12 years = 1.25x (25% surcharge)
$2,700 √ó 1.25 = $3,375

// STEP 6: Wind Zone
Zone 3 = 1.1x (10% surcharge)
$3,375 √ó 1.1 = $3,713

// STEP 7: Wind Mitigation
Hip roof = -12%
Impact glass = -20%
Total: -32% discount
$3,713 √ó 0.68 = $2,525

// STEP 8: Claims History
No claims = 0.95x (5% discount)
$2,525 √ó 0.95 = $2,399

// STEP 9: Deductible
$2,500 standard = no change
$2,399 √ó 1.0 = $2,399

// STEP 10: Florida Fees
FHCF: $24
FIGA: $24
EMPA: $10
Policy: $25
Total fees: $83

// FINAL PREMIUM
$2,399 + $83 = $2,482/year ($207/month)
```

## üîç WHAT CHANGED IN THE CODE

### 1. Replacement Cost Calculation
```javascript
// Now correctly separates dwelling value from premium
const replacementCost = sqft * 150;  // What it costs to rebuild
updateField('dwellingLimit', replacementCost);  // This is coverage, NOT premium
```

### 2. Base Premium Calculation
```javascript
// Premium is a SMALL PERCENTAGE of dwelling value
const baseRatePercent = 0.008;  // 0.8% is typical
let premium = replacementCost * baseRatePercent;

// Example: $300,000 dwelling √ó 0.008 = $2,400/year
// NOT $300,000/year!
```

### 3. County Multipliers (Realistic)
```javascript
const countyMultiplier = {
  'Miami-Dade': 1.5,    // $2,400 ‚Üí $3,600 (50% higher)
  'Monroe': 1.8,        // $2,400 ‚Üí $4,320 (80% higher - Keys)
  'Orlando': 1.0,       // $2,400 ‚Üí $2,400 (baseline)
  'Jacksonville': 0.85  // $2,400 ‚Üí $2,040 (15% lower)
};
```

### 4. Roof Age Multipliers (Realistic)
```javascript
if (roofAge <= 5) premium *= 0.85;      // -15% (save $360)
else if (roofAge <= 10) premium *= 1.0;  // Standard
else if (roofAge <= 15) premium *= 1.25; // +25% (add $600)
else if (roofAge <= 20) premium *= 1.75; // +75% (add $1,800)
else premium *= 2.5;                     // +150% (add $3,600)
```

### 5. Carrier-Specific Rates
```javascript
const carrierBaseRates = {
  'Progressive': 0.0075,  // 0.75% - most competitive
  'Universal': 0.008,     // 0.8% - standard
  'Tower Hill': 0.0085,   // 0.85% - higher
  'FedNat': 0.0078,       // 0.78% - competitive
  'Citizens': 0.0082      // 0.82% - last resort
};

// Example for $300,000 dwelling:
// Progressive: $300,000 √ó 0.0075 = $2,250
// Universal: $300,000 √ó 0.008 = $2,400
// Citizens: $300,000 √ó 0.0082 = $2,460
```
